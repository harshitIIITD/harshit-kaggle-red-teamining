# Execution Plan — Lean, Local, OpenRouter‑only Red‑Teaming System for `gpt-oss-20b`

> This plan operationalizes the attached **spec.md** into an incremental, risk‑first, TDD‑driven execution path with concrete prompts for a code‑gen LLM. It assumes local **docker‑compose**, **OpenRouter** for all model calls, a durable **SQLite** state for pause/resume, a rich **seed attack library**, mutators, a bandit‑guided orchestrator, novelty/dedupe, and a minimal dashboard.  
> Source spec: `spec.md` (provided by user).

---

## 1) Executive Summary (Checklist)

- Clarify outcomes/constraints and test assumptions; document unknowns & decisions.  
- Identify highest‑risk areas; run **time‑boxed spikes** with success/kill criteria.  
- Build in **vertical slices**: usable UI → seed/mutator → evaluator/novelty → orchestrator → reporting.  
- Decompose into **small, TDD steps**; write tests first, integrate continuously.  
- Provide a **Prompt Pack** so a code‑gen LLM can safely implement each step.  
- Enforce **pause/resume**, cost caps, and reproducible artifacts; avoid orphaned code.  
- Roll out with observability, feature flags, and short feedback loops.

## 2) High‑Leverage Questions

1. **Competition protocol**: Are judge/helper models via OpenRouter permitted at eval time, or only for internal development? Impact: determines evaluator pathway and budget.  
2. **Exact model IDs & fallback**: Confirm `openai/gpt-oss-20b` and judge/paraphrase models’ IDs, rate limits, and pricing on OpenRouter. Impact: prevents integration churn at run time.  
3. **Allowed context window / token caps** for target and judge. Impact: shapes prompt lengths, batch sizes, and truncation strategy.  
4. **Concurrency limits** for your OpenRouter key. Impact: scheduler’s `max_concurrency` and backoff.  
5. **Ground‑truth labeling**: Do we need a human review loop before final report submission? Impact: pipeline stops vs auto‑promotion.  
6. **Report format** required by the target audience/competition: Markdown only, or also JSON/CSV? Impact: reporter outputs and acceptance tests.  
7. **PII & log retention policy**: Any additional redaction requirements beyond spec? Impact: UI and artifact filters.  
8. **Run budget/time cap**: Hard $ and hours per unattended run. Impact: bandit explore/exploit, early stopping, category allocation.  
9. **OS/network constraints**: Any corporate proxies or air‑gap quirks? Impact: httpx config and health checks.  
10. **Scope of safety categories**: Any must‑include/must‑exclude subclasses for first milestone? Impact: seed selection and mutator graphs.

Temporary assumptions if unanswered are noted below and encoded in config defaults.

## 9) Prompt Pack for Code‑Gen LLM (TDD)

> Each step below is a **standalone fenced `text` block** the code‑gen LLM can run.  
> Common constraints: Python 3.11, FastAPI, httpx, tenacity, pydantic, SQLite stdlib; **no external DB or vector store**. Docker‑compose only. Style: type hints, small functions, tests first.

### Step 1 — Bootstrap FastAPI app & health
```text
Context:
- Empty repo; goal: minimal FastAPI app under apps/runner with /status and /ui stub, config loader, .env reading.
- Repo layout root: /apps/runner/app/... ; /configs/config.yaml ; /docker-compose.yml added later.

Write tests first:
- tests/test_health.py: test_status_returns_json_counters(); test_ui_serves_basic_html().

Files to create/modify:
- apps/runner/app/main.py: FastAPI app with /status, /ui, and /control stubs returning fixed structures.
- apps/runner/app/util/config.py: load YAML (configs/config.yaml) + env overrides.
- configs/config.yaml: minimal defaults (providers.openrouter.base_url, run.max_concurrency, evaluation.judge_threshold, storage paths).
- pyproject.toml: deps fastapi, uvicorn, pydantic, httpx, tenacity, rich; pytest config.
- .env.example: OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...

Acceptance/DoD:
- `pytest` passes; `uvicorn app.main:app` serves /status with static counters, /ui returns placeholder HTML.
- Config and env load without exceptions.

Run:
- pip install -e . && pytest -q
- uvicorn apps.runner.app.main:app --reload

Constraints/Edge cases:
- Don't fail if config file missing; default to sane in-memory config.
- No global state; dependency-inject config via FastAPI `lifespan`.

Integration notes:
- /control stubs will be wired to orchestrator later; keep function signatures stable.
```

### Step 2 — OpenRouter client with retries & cost meter [COMPLETED]
```text
Context:

- apps/runner/app/util/cost.py: map usage tokens -> $ using config.
- apps/runner/app/util/schemas.py: dataclasses/TypedDicts for responses.

Acceptance:
- Mocked httpx returns deterministic content; retries occur; cost meter computes non-negative values.

Run:
- pytest -q

Constraints:
- Respect OPENROUTER_API_KEY from env; timeouts ≤60s; backoff jitter.

Integration:
- Export `async def call_or(model, messages, **params) -> tuple[str, dict]` used by runner/evaluator.
```

### Step 3 — SQLite schema & DAO with WAL + migrations [COMPLETED]
```text
Context:

Acceptance:
- New DB file created; tables exist; basic CRUD passes.

Run:
- pytest -q

Constraints:
- Use sqlite3 stdlib only; set pragmas: WAL, synchronous=NORMAL, journal_size_limit.
- Idempotent init; safe to re-run.
Integration:
- Future orchestrator will checkpoint via DAO.
```

### Step 4 — Seed library loader & deterministic mutator engine [COMPLETED]
```text
Context:
- Load parameterized seed templates; apply mutator chains deterministically by seed.

Tests first:
- tests/test_seeds_mutators.py: property tests (non-empty, bounded length, determinism for same seed); negative cases for unsafe raw strings.

Files:
- apps/runner/app/agents/crafter.py: TemplateRegistry, Mutator protocol, built-in mutators (lexical, unicode, structural, persona, language pivot).
- seeds/*.yaml or .json: a few sample templates per family with placeholders.

Acceptance:
- For (template_id, chain, seed) same output prompt; length within bounds; no exceptions.

Run:
- pytest -q

Constraints:
- No LLMs for mutators except optional paraphrase model hook (stubbed for now).

Integration:
- Expose `craft_prompt(template_id, mut_chain, seed, ctx)`.
```

### Step 5 — Attempt runner → JSONL transcripts [COMPLETED]
```text
Context:
- Compose crafted prompt, call target model (start with Llama 3.1 8B), append sanitized record to attempts.jsonl.

Tests first:
- tests/test_runner_attempts.py: test_append_jsonl_shape_and_fields(); test_error_marked_failed_temp_vs_perm().

Files:
- apps/runner/app/agents/tester.py: run_attempt(); error classification; usage capture.
- apps/runner/app/store/files.py: append_jsonl(); rotation safe.

Acceptance:
- After running a small batch, attempts.jsonl contains records with prompt/output, usage, timestamps.

Run:
- pytest -q; then small manual run fixture.

Constraints:
- Redact PII-like spans via regex before writing JSONL.
Integration:
- Outputs feed evaluator next.

## 10) Task Ordering & Critical Path

**Critical path**: OpenRouter client → DB/DAO → Attempt runner → Evaluator → Novelty → Orchestrator → Reporter → E2E.  
**Parallelizable**: UI stub, redaction helpers, tests/golden sets, runbooks.  
**Gateways**: EV‑001 decides judge threshold; NV‑001 decides novelty params; OR‑001 fixes concurrency.

---

## 11) Quality, Observability & Rollout

- **Tests**: unit (mutators, heuristics, client, DAO), property (mutators), integration (pause/resume), E2E.  
- **Metrics**: attempts/sec, success/err rates, cost per attempt, judge scores, novelty %, cluster sizes.  
- **Logs**: structured `rich` console; sample transcripts sanitized.  
- **Feature flags**: enable/disable families; choose bandit policy.  
- **Security**: redact PII before disk; CoT logs disabled by default; keys only in `.env`.  
- **Runbooks**: curl scripts for start/pause/resume; troubleshooting guide.

---

## 12) Cost/Capacity Notes

- **Drivers**: tokens (prompt length × attempts), judge calls, concurrency → retries.  
- **Controls**: heuristics prefilter, cost cap ($/run), truncation, short dry‑run loops, lower‑cost judge (8B) for dev.  
- **Target**: ≤$10 full exploratory run; ≤$1 smoke on target. Track cost in `/status` and UI.

---

## 13) Feedback & Checkpoints

- **D1 (AM)**: Slice A green; OR‑002 done; answer Q2/Q4.  
- **D1 (PM)**: Slice B; CT‑001 done; attempts.jsonl filling.  
- **D2 (AM)**: Slice C; EV‑001 done; first clusters.  
- **D2 (PM)**: Slice D; PR‑001 green; OR‑001 limits set.  
- **D3**: Slice E; E2E dry‑run & short target run; report review.

---

## 14) Decision Log

- OpenRouter‑only; no cloud infra; single compose service.  
- SQLite + JSONL for durability and simplicity.  
- MinHash/Jaccard for novelty first; embeddings deferred.  
- Bandit policy Thompson by default; UCB1 optional.  
- PII redaction regexes in UI & artifacts; CoT disabled by default.
